# Rock paper and scissors
Rock, paper and scissors is a clone of the classic game that we all used to play when we were kids. You play this game on the terminal.
You start the game with 4 points, when you win a round you have 1 extra point and if you lose the 
round, then you lose a point. If you get 0 points the game is over!

## Getting Started

project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.
